# API---Postman
API stands for Application Programming Interface.
API testing involves testing the collection of APIs and checking if they meet expectations for functionality, reliability, performance, and security and returns the correct response.
Postman is an application for testing APIs, by sending request to the web server and getting the response back.
It allows users to set up all the headers and cookies the API expects, and checks the response.
A test in Postman is fundamentally a JavaScript code, which run after a request is sent and a response has been received from the server.
